                  Each employee and their dependents are assigned to a medical plan according to their eligibility. The reporting
                  module generates different ACA reports of single or multiple employees or for the entire company which
                  includes details such the type of health cover they have and the duration of the cover (monthly or yearly
                  health cover)</p>

                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/screenshots/volent.jpg" alt="">
                <p>As a part of professional development, Mark and I visited Mosgiel community centre on 24/10/2018. It was
                  an interesting experience for me. We met with some elderly people and answered their questions related
                  to the new computing devices (phones and laptops) they are using. They were all senior citizens, but are
                  new to the technology domain. They were really intimidated by small things such as getting promotional
                  mails and getting notification like back up your data. They weren’t sure why they are receiving such emails
                  and were unsure about what to do when they receive messages about backing up data. Also, for saving of
                  passwords on browsers they were worried whether someone else may have access to their data or steal their
                  data. I taught an elderly woman about options available in mobile phone applications and how to explore
                  the options available on any mobile app. She wanted to know about Netflix app, mail app (and details such
                  as what is spam email, stared email , deleting an email, what is trash). I provided explanation on the
                  above mentioned items. I also taught her how to check the available mobile data and the previous month’s
                  mobile bills in Vodafone app. It was an eye-opening experience for me to see the kind of technological
                  problems faced by the elderly. It made me realise that as a software developer I need to think carefully
                  to create better user interface in the applications I develop so that everyone (including novice users)
                  can easily understand the functionality of an app and easily navigate through the application. The user
                  interface needs to be simple and intuitive. Also, I realise that I will need to be patient when interacting
                  with people. This will be beneficial for me when operating in a team-setting where people may have different
                  levels of understanding about technology. I also saw the difference in mindsets between young people (like
                  me) and the elderly in trusting technology. Young ones trust technology more than they should and the elderly
                  are too worried. Perhaps, the reality might be somewhere in the middle

                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/screenshots/startupweekend.png" alt="">
                <p>I attended the start up weekend held between X and Y. It was a three-day event which started on a Friday
                  evening and ended on Sunday evening. I participated as a Developer in this event. On the first day several
                  people made pitches of their ideas and then everyone voted for their favourite project.
                  <br><br> Most of the ideas that were pitched were really interesting. I liked ‘nearby offers’ app which
                  aims to push offer notification based on location. For example, if a pizza company like Dominoes wants
                  to provide an offer, it might send offers to people within a certain radius of a particular store. This
                  way, they can encourage people to buy their products more. I also liked the idea that focussed on preparing
                  food for the dogs and selling them (which is not relevant to the ICT area).
                  <br><br> I decided to join an idea proposed by Abdullah. He is a civil engineer in a construction company
                  in Dunedin. His idea was developing a mobile application for ‘clock in’ system based on geo-location. This
                  app aims to identify whether the user is in a construction zone and also computes how long the user has
                  been in the zone. Based on this information, the payroll of the user can be computed. I liked this idea
                  and I joined that group. Our group comprised of five members. The team members were Abdullah, Chris, Kezz,
                  Aaron and myself.
                  <br><br>Aaron and I worked on application development and the other three worked on the business development.
                  On Friday night we did the requirement analysis first and other guys are worked on making business models.
                  <br><br>When I attended this event, I was at the initial stage of my android course. It helped me with
                  starting up the project. I learned about location and access permission APIs in android and also the async
                  method. Initially it was hard for me to work on this project because I was new to the android platform.
                  However, I was able to make very good progress at the end of Saturday by creating an initial version of
                  the mobile application which can identify the current location of the user and also checks if the location
                  is within a site’s location.

                  <img src="img/screenshots/androidstartuplocation.PNG" style=" width:45%;height: 60%;" />
                  <br><br>While I worked on the app, Aaron worked on the database side and developed back-end API which could
                  be used from the app. I completed the app by mid-day of Sunday. I didn’t concentrate on validation and
                  UI design due to time constraints. I concentrated only on the core feature which allowed the user to clock
                  in when they are inside the construction location. The app records the clock in and clock out time in the
                  database.
                  <br><br>Before the end of the event, we had a working system (after several mini-iterations of fixing bugs).
                  We were the only group to have a working application. Some screenshots from this application and some sample
                  code are given below.
                  <br><br>

                  <img src="img/screenshots/breeze3.png" style=" width:30%;height: 40%;" />
                  <br><br>While Aaron and I worked on the implementation of the app, the other group members worked on business
                  models and elicited detailed requirements from the real workers from the construction department. This
                  formed the inputs for subsequent refinement which we pursued outside this event later on.
                  <br><br>At the end of the start-up weekend we gave a presentation about our business idea and the mobile
                  application that was developed. Our presentation was well-received. Now, this idea is being developed further
                  and I have asked to contribute to this start up project which is being funded by the construction company.
                  <br><br>I really enjoyed the whole event and I learnt about how to convert an idea into a business. I learned
                  different stages in starting up a business. I am also thrilled that I could put my skills and knowledge
                  into practice towards developing a useful application for a business. Additionally, this event provided
                  opportunity for me to work with different people focussing on different aspects of business (not just technology
                  people). I learnt that it is not just technology that makes an idea successful. We need passionate entrepreneurs,
                  venture capitalists who fund the project, project managers, marketers etc. Overall, this was a beneficial
                  learning experience for me. Also, I look forward to the commercialization of this project.

                <p>Why to talk with people who disagree with us?
                  <br><br>When we hear about the thoughts of people who disagree with our thoughts, we learn many things
                  from that. Even our decisions may change after the conversation. It may be good in some point. So, we should
                  not ignore the negative commands. we should consider other people’s thoughts that may help to take better
                  decisions.
                  <br><br>I learnt how decision making may change if we talk to the people who disagree with our thoughts
                  rather than ignoring it.
                  <br><br>Cultivate intellectual humility
                  <br><br>It talks about how our mindset should be. People who have got growth mindset will learn from their
                  mistakes. They take everything as chance to progress and learn from it. They always think positive about
                  themselves, happily accept the challenges. But people who have fixed mindset resist changes in their life.
                  They wouldn’t like to take new challenges. They are not ready to learn.
                  <br><br>I learnt that, being in growth mindset will make me grow higher and give confidence.
                  <br><br>Explore the irrational mind
                  <br><br>The content provided talks about people with automatic thinking and deliberate reasoning
                  <br><br>We should not take decisions by considering only our situations. Whenever we make decisions we
                  need to think about others’ opinions and should take decisions.
                  <br><br>Break free from moral matrix
                  <br><br>There are six moral values: Care, Fairness, Loyalty, Authority and Sanctity. People will behave
                  in a situation based on these moral values. We need to understand others’ point of view before judging
                  them. Everyone can have different view on different things. We need to put ourselves in other’s shoes to
                  understand things from their point of view.
                  <br><br>Prepare for constructive disagreement
                  <br><br>In this workshop I learnt that if somebody says that we are not correct, we need not consider this
                  as a disagreement. We can learn from others point of view. It also does not mean that we have to accept
                  that what we did was wrong. On the other hand, we need to try to understand the point and try to see what
                  we can learn from their feedback and have a positive mindset.

                  <br><br>My final thoughts:
                  <br><br>The whole workshop material talks about how our mind set actually is and how we need to change
                  it. It explained that we can learn from our mistakes and we need to treat people with different attitudes/mindsets/beliefs
                  with respect. Also, we need to understand other peoples’ thoughts. The differences could be because of
                  cultural and moral diversities. If we consider those, there is will be less misunderstanding and more unity
                  in this world. This may lead to less problems in the society. This workshop helped me to learn about how
                  to become a “better me”.

                          <p>
                            I am very excited that it is a first day at the project room. Adon gave a presentation about all ongoing projects and about
                            different project groups. I met people from various project groups and gathered information about
                            what they are all doing. All the projects are very interesting and useful. They all have a good
                            purpose (i.e., solve specific problems). At the end of the session, I was assigned a mobile application
                            project that will be used by the new students at the Otago polytechnic to explore the polytechnic
                            campus. I am going to develop this mobile application using React native and Django for web admin
                            page.

                            I installed the react native software through command prompt using the <a target="_" href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started">Getting
                              Started tutorial</a>
                            given by Facebook. I set up the configuration for the necessary system paths to make the command prompt ready to run all
                            the react native commands. Then, I installed Django using the pip command. After successful installation,
                            I created a ‘hello world’ project by following the steps in above given tutorial. But, I had
                            the following issue while running the application in android emulator.

                            <br><br>I tried several solutions such as changing the jdk and sdk paths, re-installing the package
                            to fix this issue. But it didn’t seem to be working. The hello world application kept failing
                            despite my best efforts.

                          <p>
                            I found the reason behind the error that I had last week and resolved it successfully. The error occurred because the development
                            version of android conflicted with the created react native application. So, I created a new
                            project with stable version (0.55.4) of react native instead of the latest one which solved the
                            conflict problem.

                            <br><br>What I learnt from this is that I must always need to do some research about the stable
                            version and use that stable version.
                            <br><br>I named this project as “BITCampus”. I also installed two more packages which are really
                            useful for the UI design. These packages provide lot of in-built elements that can be used for
                            designing user interfaces (e.g. provision of avatar tags to display images and listviews that
                            can be populated easily).

                          <em>August 2nd, 2018</em>
                          <p>
                            I started doing the UI design. I decided to have four pages in my application.
                            <br><br>1. Home screen - contains introduction about the polytechnic
                            <br><br>2. Campus screen - displays reconnaissance questionnaire
                            <br><br>3. Gallery screen – displays some of the campus photos and their descriptions
                            <br><br>4. User screen - displays logged in user information
                            <br><br>Designing in React Native is more like HTML programming. Because, I already know HTML
                            and I am good at designing web pages, it is a bit easy for me to understand the React Native
                            design. In addition, React-Native-Elements and Native-Base have several built-in elements (like
                            bootstrap framework for CSS) and it made my job easier for designing pages quickly.
                            <br><br>I designed the home screen with parallax effect using <a target="_" href="https://github.com/i6mi6/react-native-parallax-scroll-view">react-native-parallax-scroll-view</a>
                            <br><br>I designed the gallery screen using <a target="_" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLIn7EGvfCs&index=3&list=PLy9JCsy2u97n2sBiRhik2RlJ6hjXFmtsn">React-Native-Shared-Element-Transitions</a>

                          <p>
                            I have designed all the screens and now I am trying to connect them by providing a menu (i.e. navigation menu). I decided
                            to provide the bottom tab navigation inspired by Instagram App.
                            <br><br> Instagram App screen<br><br>
                            <img src="img/screenshots/instascreen.jpg" style=" width:60%;height: 40%;" /><br><br>

                            <br><br>React Native provides <a target="_" href="https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/bottom-tab-navigator.html">bottom-tab-navigator</a>
                            package to make this type of navigation easier to implement. I initially used the png images for the menu icon. Then I replaced
                            this with FontAwesome icons provided by NativeBase. This is because FontAwesome doesn’t take
                            much space when compared to images and also these icons look better than the png images.

                            <br><br>I am having an issue on Campus screen navigation. Campus screen contains three sub-screens
                            inside it.
                            <br><br> 1. Category screen - displays the question categories
                            <br><br> 2. List screen - displays list of different sections of selected category
                            <br><br> 3. Reconnaissance screen - displays one or many questions for the selected section
                            <br><br> I am unable to work out how to implement the functionality to select one of three options
                            from menu (i.e., when there are more than one option to be selected from a menu). When an option
                            is chosen it should take the user to the correct screen. I am still looking a solution to solve
                            this navigation problem.

                            I did some research about how to handle the multiple screens navigation without changing the selection option in the bottom
                            tab navigation menu. I finally found a solution, which is a third party package called <a
                              target="_" href="https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux">react-native-router-flux</a>
                            . This package provides router and scene facility to navigate to multiple sub-screens within one react navigation menu (see
                            code snippet below).
                            <br><br> Code snippet:<br><br>

                            created a model with all the table fields and relationships (as shown in the code below) and
                            connected it in MySQL database using the migrate command. I am familiar with Django framework.

                          <em>August 27th, 2018</em>
                          <p>
                            Now, I am trying to connect to the web API (server side) from the mobile app (client side). I can connect to the local Django
                            server’s web API to the mobile app running in emulator in the same machine. But, I am having
                            an issue on connecting the API from mobile app which is installed in a mobile phone. In other
                            words, the set up works on the emulator but not on the phone. The reason is that my web application
                            is not running as a live server on the internet. I tried to run Django server application in
                            Kate server but again it isn’t publicly accessible (i.e., can only be accessed within the Polytechnic
                            network). To solve this issue, I need to host my Django application in a public server on the
                            internet so that I can access it from anywhere in the world.

                          <em>August 30th, 2018</em>
                          <p>
                            I searched for free hosting for Django and I found a solution with <a target="_" href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/">PythonAnywhere</a>
                            which allows the user to host one python application for free. So, I decided to host my back-end service on PythonAnywhere.
                            <br><br>I tried to upload my existing Django application to the server but initially it didn’t
                            work because of the configuration set up (i.e., folder path that is mentioned in the configuration
                            set up was wrong). After a few attempts I successfully hosted my web application on PythonAnywhere
                            server.
                            <br><br>But now I am having another issue. I can’t connect to the database in the Kate server
                            because it can’t be accessed from public domain. So, I changed my database to SQLite which comes
                            in-built with Django and I migrated my model into the SQLite database.
                            <br><br>Now my Django web admin website is running on the PythonAnywhere <a target="_" href="http://robinrichard.pythonanywhere.com/">server</a>
                            and I am able to connect it from mobile app and fetch information from the database using the APIs created already.

                          <p>
                            I planned and implemented two screens related to users logging into the system. The first one is the login page for the existing
                            users to authenticate in the mobile application and the second one is the registration page for
                            the new user to create an account.
                            <br><br>I created a separate navigation called ‘stack navigation’ for login and registration
                            pages and created a switch navigator to switch between bottom tab navigation which is already
                            created and the newly created stack navigation. The logged-in users will get the bottom tab navigation
                            and who are not logged in will get the stack navigation.
                            <br><br>

                            <br><br> To maintain the log in session I am using “AsyncStorage” provided by react native to
                            store information in the mobile storage.

                            <br>Now I can login to the application by using the user created in the Django admin site and
                            validating the username and password by using the API created.

                            questions a student answered in that category along with the category name. For this I am using
                            the filter method available in the ReactNative for JSON object. I can easily calculate the count
                            by simple filter query.

                            and display them in a list. I also add a flag to each section indicating whether all the questions
                            in that section are answered. The user can select the section and can view all the questions
                            in that section and submit their response.

                            This is the actual screen where an user can enter their answers to the reconnaissance questions. Every question will be displayed
                            from the database. If a section has multiple questions the questions will be displayed in many

                            and provide answers for these questions. I categorised the questions in three categories. They
                            are

                            For the link question, the user presses the link and is shown appropriate information. For the
                            task question, the answer provided by the user needs to be validated. For example, a task might
                            to be find a particular book shelf in a library. To do this, I need to validate whether the student
                            found the correct location. For this I decided to make use of QR code validation. The user can
                            easily answer the question by finding the place by reading the instruction given along with the
                            question and scan the QR code pasted in that location.
                            <br><br>For the task question, I need to add a privilege for the admin in Django application

                            The user will then be directed to the login screen.

                          <p>
                            Now I am having a problem when navigating back from the current screen to the previous screen (e.g. reconnaissance screen
                            or section screen to category screen). It displays the old data and does not display the updated
                            data from the database. I did some search on the internet on refreshing the screen while navigating
                            back to previous screen and found about navigation listeners (e.g. didFocus and didBlur). When
                            a user wants to go back to the previous screen from the current screen, the current screen’s
                            didBlur method will blur the screen while the previous screen’s didFocus fetches the refreshed
                            data on the previous screen. I created a separate method to add each of those listeners (see
                            snippet below).
                            <br><br>Code snippet for adding the two types of listeners are given below:

                            To validate the task questions, the admin needs to create QR code for the questions. For this I used <a

                            database and generated the QR code with that validator for that question. The validator column
                            has string data that represents an unique identifier. This identifier is displayed in the form
                            of QR code. The admin can get the QR code as a PDF file. For PDF generation I am using <a target="_"

                            Today I am going to work on implementing profile picture upload option in User creation of Django application . PythonAnywhere
                            allows files to be uploaded. I used Ajax post request to send the image file with form data to
                            a Django method. Then I retrieve the image file from the request and store it in a file location
                            in PythonAnywhere server and store the file path of that image in the database.
                            <br><br>Then I changed my user screen in the mobile app so that it fetched the profile picture
                            of the user from the PythonAnywhere server and shows it in the screen in an avatar element provided
                            by the React-Native-Elements package.

                          <p>
                            Today I am working on the user registration screen in the React Native app. Any user can install the app and register using
                            his/her email address and sign in to the application. I used <a target="_"
                              href="https://github.com/gcanti/tcomb-form-native">“tcomb-form-native”</a> which provides an
                            easy way to create forms for the user registration screen. The user can enter all the details
                            in that screen (e.g. user name).
                            <br><img src="img/screenshots/form.PNG" style=" width:60%;height: 40%;" />
                            <br><br>Once the user details are entered, I retrieve them and save them in the user table of
                            the database and then Django server will send an email with the link to the given email address.
                            The user’s status in the database table at this stage will be inactive. Hence, the user needs
                            to activate their credentials by clicking on the link given in the email. Upon activation, the
                            user status becomes active. After registration, the screen will redirect to the profile picture
                            upload screen where users can upload their profile picture or skip if they do not want to upload
                            the profile picture.

                            Today I am working on the Gallery screen. Previously the Gallery screen in the mobile application displayed only the images
                            stored in the application were static (i.e., once the application is installed there was no way
                            of adding new images or updating the old ones in the gallery). However, I would like this to
                            be dynamic so that admin can change the images whenever he/she wants to change and this is reflected
                            in the mobile app. For example, if information about a new building needs to be included, the
                            image and description can be uploaded to the server by the admin anytime which then gets pushed
                            to the mobile app.
                            <br><br> So, whenever the gallery screen gets focus, it retrieves the available images from the
                            database and displays all of them in the app.

                          <p>
                            I have pretty much done all the development work. Today I am working on the validations part for the Django web application.
                            I have done all the form validations such as required field validation, user email existence
                            for all the webpages in the application. Screenshots and code of validations are provided below.

                            Today I have done all the validations for the mobile application. Similar to the web application, I did all the form validations

                            Yay! It is the final week for the project completion. I am finally trying to upload the BITCampus application to the play
                            store using the BIT account. I faced a problem in bundling scripts and images from the React
                            Native to Android. I tried many solutions from the internet and nothing worked. At the end of
                            the day I found that it was a silly mistake. I was trying to bundle images that had already been
                            bundled in the to-be-deployed folder. This was causing conflicts. However, the error message
                            wasn’t useful which showed “apt error”. I had to google the reason for the error and figured
                            out the reason. To fix this issue, I deleted the src folder from the android project and then
                            created the bundle successfully. I uploaded the apk file to the play store and you can now download
                            it from this <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitcampus">link</a>

                          <em>November 22th, 2018</em>
                          <p>
                            Today is the last day in the project room. I deleted test data and added the real data provided by Joy Gasson at the start
                            of the project. I have tested my application using the live data.
                            <br><br>Yay, things are working as expected. I am delighted that I was able to complete the project
                            successfully.
                            <br><br>I learnt a lot from this project. Below, I have highlighted certain specific aspects
                            I learnt from this project.
                            <br><br>a) NativeReact was a new framework and I had to learn it from scratch myself. That was
                            a good learning experience.
                            <br><br> b) This project provided opportunities for me to develop both the client side mobile
                            application and the server side web application. The skills I learnt will be valuable for my
                            aspirations to become a web-developer and/or mobile-app developer.
                            <br><br>c) Image uploading from a client to a server and displaying a stored image to a mobile
                            application was new to me. I am glad to have learnt the skills to perform this activity.
                            <br><br>d) Generating QR code and reading QR code was also new to me. I learnt how to generate
                            and read this. Generation of QR code was done in the server side using Django and the reading
                            was performed through the mobile app.

                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/screenshots/volent.jpg" alt="">
                <p>As a part of professional development, Mark and I visited Mosgiel community centre on 24/10/2018. It was
                  an interesting experience for me. We met with some elderly people and answered their questions related
                  to the new computing devices (phones and laptops) they are using. They were all senior citizens, but are
                  new to the technology domain. They were really intimidated by small things such as getting promotional
                  mails and getting notification like back up your data. They weren’t sure why they are receiving such emails
                  and were unsure about what to do when they receive messages about backing up data. Also, for saving of
                  passwords on browsers they were worried whether someone else may have access to their data or steal their
                  data. I taught an elderly woman about options available in mobile phone applications and how to explore
                  the options available on any mobile app. She wanted to know about Netflix app, mail app (and details such
                  as what is spam email, stared email , deleting an email, what is trash). I provided explanation on the
                  above mentioned items. I also taught her how to check the available mobile data and the previous month’s
                  mobile bills in Vodafone app. It was an eye-opening experience for me to see the kind of technological
                  problems faced by the elderly. It made me realise that as a software developer I need to think carefully
                  to create better user interface in the applications I develop so that everyone (including novice users)
                  can easily understand the functionality of an app and easily navigate through the application. The user
                  interface needs to be simple and intuitive. Also, I realise that I will need to be patient when interacting
                  with people. This will be beneficial for me when operating in a team-setting where people may have different
                  levels of understanding about technology. I also saw the difference in mindsets between young people (like
                  me) and the elderly in trusting technology. Young ones trust technology more than they should and the elderly
                  are too worried. Perhaps, the reality might be somewhere in the middle

                <h2 class="text-uppercase">Start-up weekend</h2>
                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/screenshots/startupweekend.png" alt="">
                <p>I attended the start up weekend held between X and Y. It was a three-day event which started on a Friday
                  evening and ended on Sunday evening. I participated as a Developer in this event. On the first day several
                  people made pitches of their ideas and then everyone voted for their favourite project.
                  <br><br> Most of the ideas that were pitched were really interesting. I liked ‘nearby offers’ app which
                  aims to push offer notification based on location. For example, if a pizza company like Dominoes wants
                  to provide an offer, it might send offers to people within a certain radius of a particular store. This
                  way, they can encourage people to buy their products more. I also liked the idea that focussed on preparing
                  food for the dogs and selling them (which is not relevant to the ICT area).
                  <br><br> I decided to join an idea proposed by Abdullah. He is a civil engineer in a construction company
                  in Dunedin. His idea was developing a mobile application for ‘clock in’ system based on geo-location. This
                  app aims to identify whether the user is in a construction zone and also computes how long the user has
                  been in the zone. Based on this information, the payroll of the user can be computed. I liked this idea
                  and I joined that group. Our group comprised of five members. The team members were Abdullah, Chris, Kezz,
                  Aaron and myself.
                  <br><br>Aaron and I worked on application development and the other three worked on the business development.
                  On Friday night we did the requirement analysis first and other guys are worked on making business models.
                  <br><br>When I attended this event, I was at the initial stage of my android course. It helped me with
                  starting up the project. I learned about location and access permission APIs in android and also the async
                  method. Initially it was hard for me to work on this project because I was new to the android platform.
                  However, I was able to make very good progress at the end of Saturday by creating an initial version of
                  the mobile application which can identify the current location of the user and also checks if the location
                  is within a site’s location.

                  <img src="img/screenshots/androidstartuplocation.PNG" style=" width:45%;height: 60%;" />
                  <br><br>While I worked on the app, Aaron worked on the database side and developed back-end API which could
                  be used from the app. I completed the app by mid-day of Sunday. I didn’t concentrate on validation and
                  UI design due to time constraints. I concentrated only on the core feature which allowed the user to clock
                  in when they are inside the construction location. The app records the clock in and clock out time in the
                  database.
                  <br><br>Before the end of the event, we had a working system (after several mini-iterations of fixing bugs).
                  We were the only group to have a working application. Some screenshots from this application and some sample
                  code are given below.
                  <br><br>
                  <img src="img/screenshots/breez1.png" style=" width:30%;height: 40%;" />
                  <img src="img/screenshots/breeze2.png" style=" width:30%;height: 40%;" />
                  <img src="img/screenshots/breeze3.png" style=" width:30%;height: 40%;" />
                  <br><br>While Aaron and I worked on the implementation of the app, the other group members worked on business
                  models and elicited detailed requirements from the real workers from the construction department. This
                  formed the inputs for subsequent refinement which we pursued outside this event later on.
                  <br><br>At the end of the start-up weekend we gave a presentation about our business idea and the mobile
                  application that was developed. Our presentation was well-received. Now, this idea is being developed further
                  and I have asked to contribute to this start up project which is being funded by the construction company.
                  <br><br>I really enjoyed the whole event and I learnt about how to convert an idea into a business. I learned
                  different stages in starting up a business. I am also thrilled that I could put my skills and knowledge
                  into practice towards developing a useful application for a business. Additionally, this event provided
                  opportunity for me to work with different people focussing on different aspects of business (not just technology
                  people). I learnt that it is not just technology that makes an idea successful. We need passionate entrepreneurs,
                  venture capitalists who fund the project, project managers, marketers etc. Overall, this was a beneficial
                  learning experience for me. Also, I look forward to the commercialization of this project.

                <h2 class="text-uppercase">Diversity workshop</h2>
                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/screenshots/diversity.PNG" alt="">
                <p>Why to talk with people who disagree with us?
                  <br><br>When we hear about the thoughts of people who disagree with our thoughts, we learn many things
                  from that. Even our decisions may change after the conversation. It may be good in some point. So, we should
                  not ignore the negative commands. we should consider other people’s thoughts that may help to take better
                  decisions.
                  <br><br>I learnt how decision making may change if we talk to the people who disagree with our thoughts
                  rather than ignoring it.
                  <br><br>Cultivate intellectual humility
                  <br><br>It talks about how our mindset should be. People who have got growth mindset will learn from their
                  mistakes. They take everything as chance to progress and learn from it. They always think positive about
                  themselves, happily accept the challenges. But people who have fixed mindset resist changes in their life.
                  They wouldn’t like to take new challenges. They are not ready to learn.
                  <br><br>I learnt that, being in growth mindset will make me grow higher and give confidence.
                  <br><br>Explore the irrational mind
                  <br><br>The content provided talks about people with automatic thinking and deliberate reasoning
                  <br><br>We should not take decisions by considering only our situations. Whenever we make decisions we
                  need to think about others’ opinions and should take decisions.
                  <br><br>Break free from moral matrix
                  <br><br>There are six moral values: Care, Fairness, Loyalty, Authority and Sanctity. People will behave
                  in a situation based on these moral values. We need to understand others’ point of view before judging
                  them. Everyone can have different view on different things. We need to put ourselves in other’s shoes to
                  understand things from their point of view.
                  <br><br>Prepare for constructive disagreement
                  <br><br>In this workshop I learnt that if somebody says that we are not correct, we need not consider this
                  as a disagreement. We can learn from others point of view. It also does not mean that we have to accept
                  that what we did was wrong. On the other hand, we need to try to understand the point and try to see what
                  we can learn from their feedback and have a positive mindset.

                  <br><br>My final thoughts:
                  <br><br>The whole workshop material talks about how our mind set actually is and how we need to change
                  it. It explained that we can learn from our mistakes and we need to treat people with different attitudes/mindsets/beliefs
                  with respect. Also, we need to understand other peoples’ thoughts. The differences could be because of
                  cultural and moral diversities. If we consider those, there is will be less misunderstanding and more unity
                  in this world. This may lead to less problems in the society. This workshop helped me to learn about how
                  to become a “better me”.
